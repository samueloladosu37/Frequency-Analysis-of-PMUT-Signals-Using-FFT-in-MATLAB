# Frequency-Analysis-of-PMUT-Signals-Using-FFT-in-MATLAB
The primary goal of this analysis is to extract the dominant frequency components of the PMUT signal, identify peak resonances, and evaluate the frequency response characteristics. This is crucial for understanding the performance of the transducer, optimizing its design, and validating theoretical models.

### **Introduction**  
This project involves the experimental analysis of **Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (PMUTs)** by acquiring and processing their transmitted and received signals. The data was collected from an **oscilloscope**, which captured the oscillatory response of the PMUT system over time. To analyze the frequency components of these signals, **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** techniques were implemented in MATLAB.    

1. **Signal Acquisition:**  
   - Under the probe station, the PMUT device was excited, and its response was measured using an oscilloscope.  
   - Time-domain signals were recorded for both transmitted and received waves.  

2. **Data Processing:**  
   - The acquired time-domain signals were imported into MATLAB.  
   - FFT was applied to transform the signals from the time domain to the frequency domain.

3. **Preprocessing:**  
   - The raw data was cleaned, and any unwanted noise was filtered.  
   - The time-varying signal was normalized if necessary.  

4. **Fourier Transform Implementation:**  
   - MATLAB's built-in `fft` function was used to compute the frequency spectrum.  
   - The frequency bins were determined based on the sampling rate.  
   - Magnitude spectrum was plotted to visualize dominant frequencies.
   - Significant peaks were detected in the frequency spectrum.  
   - These peaks correspond to the resonant frequencies of the PMUT device.  

### **Significance**  
- The results helped in characterizing the **resonant frequency and bandwidth** of the PMUT.  
- Understanding these frequency peaks is essential for applications in **ultrasonic imaging, sensing, and communication**.  
- The methodology provides a framework for further signal processing and system optimization.
