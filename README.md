# Frequency-Analysis-of-PMUT-Signals-Using-FFT-in-MATLAB
The primary goal of this analysis is to extract the dominant frequency components of the PMUT signal, identify peak resonances, and evaluate the frequency response characteristics. This is crucial for understanding the performance of the transducer, optimizing its design, and validating theoretical models.
